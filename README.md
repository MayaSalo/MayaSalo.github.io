Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in Michal Ramot and Yaniv Ziv labs.
I am married to Ben and we have a 1.5 years old girl named Naomi.

I did my BSc in Psychobiology at the Hebrew University.
My current project is a direct continue of my MSc project.

I study the stability of the mental representation of external natural stimuli (movies) in human participants in ultra-high field fMRI.
In me experiment I scan participants 8 times spanning a month, while watching the same 5-minute movie clips.
